# DPI912-Term-Project-Team-1 Proposal

KEYQUESTIONS
-Who is your target
-How you propose to get your code into their system
-What will the innocuous code do?
-What will your malicious code do?
-What is the objective/desired outcome from the execution of the attack

Our Idea for the project is a simple chat room program that will have a keylogger running in the background.
